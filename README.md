# Airport data analysis using Big Data Frameworks
HELLO!

This project is part of CSE3120 Big Data Analytics course. The database was taken from edureka. The aim of this project is to implement map-reduce on Airport data and genrate key value pairs for different field pairs.
Later pyspark was used to implement SQL. 18 differnet queries were executed and outputs were converted to dataframes using Pandas and bar plots, histograms and pie charts were implemented to visulaize the results.
In the end part, a linear regression model was trained to predict the number of passengers travelling from origin airport to destination airport and  r-squared error of model was 0.94.

Thank you!
